## 📑 30 Minutes Coding Challenges

Welcome to **30 Minutes Coding Challenges** — a Python-based desktop app (converted to `.exe`) built to help you stay focused, practice typing, and commit at least **30 minutes daily** to learning and creating something new.

---

## 📌 About the Project

This is a simple Notepad-like application, but with a twist:

* You get exactly **30 minutes** on the timer.
* During that time, you must **keep typing continuously** — no copy-pasting allowed.
* When the **timer reaches 0**, the app **automatically stops** and **saves your file** to a predefined location.
* It's designed to improve consistency, focus, typing practice, and encourage daily learning.

I created this for myself as a way to stay disciplined and learn something new each day in small, manageable chunks of time.


## 📦 Features

* ⏳ **30-minute countdown timer**
* 📃 **Simple text editor interface**
* ❌ **Disables copy-paste functionality**
* 💾 **Auto-save when timer hits 0**
* 📂 Saves your work in a specified location with a timestamped filename
* 🖊️ Encourages free-form writing, coding, or idea jotting
* 📈 Helps build a daily learning habit


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* `tkinter` (for GUI)
* `time`, `os`, `datetime` modules
* Packaged to `.exe` using **PyInstaller**

### 📌 Or run the executable:

* Download the `.exe` file from the **Releases** section.
* Double-click to start your 30-minute challenge.

## 📁 How It Works

1. Launch the app.
2. The **30-minute timer** starts immediately.
3. Start typing — you **cannot paste text** into the editor.
4. When the timer runs out:

   * The text is **automatically saved** as a `.txt` file with the current date and time in a chosen folder.
   * The editor closes, and your progress is recorded.


## 🎯 Why I Built This

> *“I wanted a simple, disciplined tool that forces me to dedicate 30 minutes every day to learn or create something new. No distractions, no shortcuts — just type. It’s a productivity hack for myself and anyone else who wants to develop a regular learning habit.”*
